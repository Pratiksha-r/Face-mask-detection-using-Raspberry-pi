# Face-mask-detection-using-Raspberry-pi

## Problem Statement
Design a methodology to detect whether a person is masked or not.

## Abstract
In this project, we try to design deep neural network towards Face Mask Detection, a network that tells us whether a person is wearing a mask or not. In the past two years, the pandemic has forced us to wear masks. We need to be masked to enter any public place like universities, shopping malls, etc. An automated mask detection system would be helpful in monitoring the crowd at all times whether there are any defaulters. Deep Neural Networks provide efficient way to design our methodology using its key processes. This can be applicable in crowded places like shopping malls, movie theatres etc.
