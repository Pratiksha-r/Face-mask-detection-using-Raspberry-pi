# Face-mask-detection-using-Raspberry-pi

## Problem Statement
Design a methodology to detect whether a person is masked or not.

## Abstract
In this project, we try to design deep neural network towards Face Mask Detection, a network that tells us whether a person is wearing a mask or not. In the past two years, the pandemic has forced us to wear masks. We need to be masked to enter any public place like universities, shopping malls, etc. An automated mask detection system would be helpful in monitoring the crowd at all times whether there are any defaulters. Deep Neural Networks provide efficient way to design our methodology using its key processes. This can be applicable in crowded places like shopping malls, movie theatres etc.

## Motivation
- The best prevention at times of a pandemic is to utilize facial coverings. Wearing masks is one such way to reduce the transmission of infections from breathing, speaking, coughing, sneezing, transmission.  
- Monitoring large groups of people in public areas who comply with rules set by the governments has become a challenge in the past two years. With machine learning algorithms, building a face mask detection system would assist the automation task and help mitigate the risk. 

## Objective
- Develop an algorithm to perform mask detection.
- Detect masks for multiple people.
- Signal whether mask found or not found using Buzzer.

## Dataset
Real World Masked Face Dataset.
The dataset contains 1376 images collected from the Real-world Masked Face Detection (RMFD) dataset. They are divided into two classes:
- with-mask: 690 images
- without-mask: 686 images

## Hardware used
- Raspberry Pi 4
- 5 MP Camera
- Piezelectric Buzzer
- SD card 

## All modules integrated in Raspberrypi
